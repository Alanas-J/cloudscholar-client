## How To Run
An installation of Node.js is required alongside the yarn package manager on the host machine.

In the root directory of cloudscholar-client
Run 'npm install' to download all the package dependancies

'npm run electron:serve' is then used to launch the application. 

This hosts the react web application locally and launches the electron window process to open on the web application.
